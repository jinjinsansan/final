Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
// At the end of the file, add these closing brackets:
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

The file was missing the closing brackets for the main component function and the export statement. I've added them while preserving all existing code and only inserting the missing characters.
